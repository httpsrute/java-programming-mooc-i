This repository contains **my personal solutions** to the exercises from the **Java Programming I** course offered by the **University of Helsinki** through [mooc.fi](https://mooc.fi/en/).

## About the Course

The full **Java Programming** MOOC is divided into two main parts:

- **Programming I** – beginner level (covered in this repo)
- **Programming II** – intermediate level ([see my solutions here](https://github.com/your-username/java-programming-mooc-ii))

This repository covers the following sections:

```
Java Programming I (Parts 1–7).
```

Each part includes theory, interactive lessons, and a wide variety of practical exercises with automatic feedback.
